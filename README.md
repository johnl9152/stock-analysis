# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Through the utilization of Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, we can program and interact with excel to find out the difference between 2017 and 2018 stocks of an energy company and if it is worth to invest. We programmed subroutine, loops, and timer in the original script and refactored script to compare and contrast which program ran the VBA faster.
