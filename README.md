# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Through the utilization of Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, we can program and interact with excel to find out the difference between 2017 and 2018 stocks of an energy company and if it is worth to invest. We programmed subroutine, loops, and timer in the original script and refactored script to compare and contrast which program ran the VBA faster.

## Results
The excel sheet for 2017 and 2018 green stock data table was downloaded and compared between the two years. The screenshots of the two years are shown as below. Each data table shows the same columns: "Ticker", "Total Daily Volume", "Return". The "Ticker" is the shortend version of the stock name. The "Total Daily Volume" is the amount of stocks traded daily. The "Return" shows the percentage earned back from the stock every day. The color green is represented as positive earning and the color red is the opposite, which is the percentage loss per day. This was achived through the conditional formatting in VBA, which immediately shows the readers which stock was doing good and bad each year.

In 2017, all the energy stocks did well, especially DQ with 199.4% return. However, TERP was fairly under valued with -7.2% return in 2017. After a year, there was a big turnout for RUN and ENPH, only two companies to have positive turnout compared to the rest of the green stocks. All the rest of the companies except for RUN and ENPH with all negative returns.
